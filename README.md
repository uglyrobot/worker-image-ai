### Setup and Deployment

1. **Clone Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure all required dependencies are installed with `npm install`.
3. **Environment Configuration:**
   Use Wrangler to define environment variables and integrate the KV store.

   - **Define Environment Variables:**
     Use the Wrangler CLI or the Cloudflare Dashboard to securely add the following environment variables as secrets:

     **Using Wrangler CLI:**
     ```bash
     wrangler secret put API_KEY
     wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY
     ```

     **Using Cloudflare Dashboard:**
     1. Navigate to your Worker‚Äôs settings in the Cloudflare Dashboard.
     2. Go to the **"Environment Variables"** section.
     3. Add `API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` as new secrets.

   - **Integrate KV Store:**
     Create a KV namespace for `IMAGE_ANALYSIS` using Wrangler:

     ```bash
     wrangler kv:namespace create "IMAGE_ANALYSIS"
     ```

     This command will output a Namespace ID. Add it to your `wrangler.toml` under the respective environment:

     ```toml
     [[env.production.kv_namespaces]]
     binding = "IMAGE_ANALYSIS"
     id = "your_namespace_id"
     ```

4. **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:**
   Deploy the code using Wrangler with the specified environment:

   ```bash
   wrangler publish --env production
   ```

### Development

To configure your development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.dev.vars` File:**

	In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.dev.vars`.

2. **Define Environment Variables:**

	Add the required environment variables to the `.dev.vars` file. For example:

	```env
	GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
	API_KEY=your_api_key
	```

3. **Start a development server for testing and debugging:**

	```bash
	npm run dev
	```
